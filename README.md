There are 4 major parts in this python module:
    Part1: A crawler that can download all tex files from http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/all/list/
    Part2: A python wrapper to compile tex file into PDF
    Part3: A function that can convert pdf to images, and then prune the image to proper size
    Part4: Generate HTML file to catigorize images by tags.

To get the final result(the HTML file), one can execute run.py. It takes about 15 minutes on my laptop to get the HTML with all the images.
